# Java Best Practices and Reference Snippets

This directory contains a curated collection of Java code examples, design patterns, and utility classes that I consider useful, reusable, or worth preserving. It is intended as a personal reference to support clean architecture, maintainability, and consistency across Java projects.

## Purpose

Over time, certain patterns, utility functions, and validation strategies repeat themselves across projects. This repository acts as a centralized space to store those elements with clear examples, so they can be reused or refined in future work.

## Structure

- **Validation**: Centralized validation logic for commands or value objects.
- **Domain patterns**: Examples of command handlers, aggregates, repositories, etc.
- **Exception handling**: Structured custom exceptions with clear boundaries.
- **Testing**: Unit test patterns, mocking techniques, and test data builders.
- **Documentation**: Headers, templates, or conventions for code clarity and Git usage.

## Contribution

This repository is maintained as a personal toolkit. Contributions are welcome in the form of ideas or critiques, but the goal is to remain selective and focused on high-quality, reusable patterns.

## Naming and formatting guidelines

- File names should reflect their purpose, e.g. `DivisionTypeCommandValidator.java`.
- Code blocks may include standardized headers such as:
  
  ```java
  /* =========================================================================
   * MODULE        : Division Types
   * PURPOSE       : Centralized validation for command inputs
   * CREATED BY    : [Your Name]
   * ========================================================================= */
