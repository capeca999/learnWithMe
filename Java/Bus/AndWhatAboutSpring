Dependency Injection: Manual vs Spring

Context
In this project, we use a manual dependency injection system via the SimpleInjection class. This approach gives us full control but lacks the features and automation provided by mature frameworks like Spring.

Below is a comparison between our current approach and how it would be implemented using Spring's dependency injection container.

Our Manual System: SimpleInjection
We use a lightweight service locator called SimpleInjection to register and retrieve dependencies.

Example

SimpleInjection container = new SimpleInjection();

MyService myService = new MyService();
container.register(MyService.class, myService);

MyService resolved = container.resolve(MyService.class);




Registration and resolution are manual.
No lifecycle management or automatic wiring.
Suitable for simple or lightweight environments.

Spring Dependency Injection
Spring uses annotations and a component scan mechanism to automatically manage and inject dependencies.

Example

@Component
public class MyService {}

@Component
public class MyController {

    private final MyService myService;

    @Autowired
    public MyController(MyService myService) {
        this.myService = myService;
    }
}

Objects are automatically created, injected, and managed by the Spring container.

You don‚Äôt need to manually register or resolve anything.

It supports lifecycle hooks, scopes, profiles, conditional beans, and more.

üìù Conclusion
Our manual injection approach with SimpleInjection is simple and flexible, making it suitable for lightweight use cases or environments without a DI framework. However, for larger systems or when more advanced features are needed (e.g., scopes, lifecycle hooks, conditional beans), adopting Spring‚Äôs DI container would be more appropriate.

If migrating to Spring in the future, each handler and service can be annotated with @Component, and buses can be injected using @Autowired or constructor injection.
