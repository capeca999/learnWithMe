It is used with Classes or abstract classes

This means that this class inherits from another class (Abstract or not)

extends – Inheriting from a class
You use extends when your class inherits from another class (abstract or concrete).

You get its methods and properties (can override them).

You can only extend one class (Java doesn’t support multiple inheritance).


public abstract class Animal {
    public void breathe() {
        System.out.println("Breathing");
    }

    public abstract void makeSound();
}

public class Dog extends Animal {
    @Override
    public void makeSound() {
        System.out.println("Woof");
    }
}
