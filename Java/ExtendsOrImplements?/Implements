Implements is with Interfaces, it is like a contract (THIS CLASS AGREES TO FOLLOW A CONTRACT DEFINED BY THE INTERFACE(s))


implements â€“ Implementing an interface
You use implements when your class promises to implement methods defined by an interface.

An interface is like a contract with method signatures only (no logic).

A class can implement multiple interfaces.


public interface Vehicle {
    void drive();
}

public interface Electric {
    void charge();
}

public class Tesla implements Vehicle, Electric {
    @Override
    public void drive() {
        System.out.println("Driving silently");
    }

    @Override
    public void charge() {
        System.out.println("Charging battery");
    }
}
