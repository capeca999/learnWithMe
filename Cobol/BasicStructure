In order to create a cobol program you need this structure:

IDENTIFICATION DIVISION.

The division is used to identify basic information about the program.

PROGRAM-ID. HELLO

In this case, we are saying that the id for the program is HELLO

ENVIRONMENT DIVISION.

Here will be almost always empty. Cobol is meant to be used on many machines, so if there is a case that you need to put a difference between computers.

DATA DIVISION.

Hwew you will contain any data that the program operates on.

PROCEDURE DIVISION.

This is the heart of the program, basically the work intended by the programmer.

This division contains two paragraphs:

PROGRAM-BEGIN and PROGRAM-DONE


Then STOP RUN. As it says, the program is stoped.
